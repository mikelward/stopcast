/**
 * The location fix-selection policy: pure, JVM-testable off a device, and framework-free.
 * The Android layer (`AndroidLocationProvider`) reads the last-known fix and supplies a
 * suspending [FixSelection.resolve] `freshFix` that wraps `LocationManager`; the decision
 * of *which* fix to trust — and when to fail honestly rather than show a stale one — lives
 * here in `app.stopcast.domain` so it can be exercised without Android (SPEC *Finding stops*).
 *
 * The policy exists to fix the field bug where "Finding stops near you…" waited ~5 s and
 * then failed with "couldn't get your location":
 *
 * 1. a **recent** cached fix (age ≤ [freshEnoughMillis]) is returned at once — instant, and
 *    accurate enough for nearby stops (SPEC *don't make the user wait*);
 * 2. otherwise a fresh fix is awaited under [timeoutMillis];
 * 3. if the fresh fix is slow (timeout) or absent, a cached fix is used rather than
 *    failing — but only while it is within [maxFallbackAgeMillis]. A cached fix older than
 *    that is rejected: the user may have traveled since, and showing a previous location's
 *    stops as "near me now" is worse than an honest failure they can retry;
 * 4. with no usable cached fix and no fresh one it returns `null` — the honest
 *    "couldn't get your location".
 *
 * Steps 3 and 4 log a sanitized reason (never a coordinate), so a location failure is
 * diagnosable from the debug log (SPEC principle 2 / *Privacy*).
