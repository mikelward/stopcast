 * The two strings the destination line renders for a branching row — the [terminus] and the
 * [branch] (slash included). The composable lays the branch out at its natural width and gives the
 * terminus the leftover (ellipsized), so these strings are already chosen to fit that split. The
 * full-name [contentDescription] is kept for a screen reader when the visible terminus is shortened
 * or hidden, and is null when the terminus shows in full. [branchDescription] does the same for the
 * branch: the full branch ("via Newbury Park") when a shortened one shows beside the terminus, or
 * the whole route ("Hainault via Newbury Park") when the branch stands alone; null when the branch
 * shows in full.

/**
 * Chooses the destination-line strings for a branching row from the glyph widths the caller
 * measured (all in px), so the rule is unit-testable apart from the measuring composable. The
 * branch joins with a slash, "/$branch".
 *
 * The **branch is never cut** — it is the cue that tells a branching line's two trunks apart, so
 * truncating it would lose which train this is. **Both sides are abbreviated before either is cut**
 * (maintainer, 2026-09-25): the full branch is kept while the terminus, in full or word-abbreviated,
 * fits beside it (the terminus yields first); otherwise the branch takes its abbreviated form and the
 * terminus the rest — its full name when that fits, its word-abbreviated form when it doesn't, and
 * its floor (first word + initials, `DestinationAbbreviations.floor`) otherwise, which the caller
 * ellipsizes with a single "…" (never a mid-glyph cut) if even the floor overflows the leftover.
 *
 * The one degenerate case is a row too narrow for even the terminus floor's first glyph beside the
 * whole short branch, at a large accessibility font scale: there the branch takes the row **alone
 * and bare** (no leading slash, so no orphaned "/"), the full name kept for a screen reader.
 *
 * @param label the full terminus name
 * @param abbreviatedLabel [label] with common whole words shortened (`DestinationAbbreviations.abbreviate`)
 * @param floorLabel [label] reduced to its first word plus later-word initials (`DestinationAbbreviations.floor`)
 * @param branch the via-branch as TfL gives it here ("Charing X", or a longer raw form)
 * @param abbreviatedBranch [branch] word-abbreviated (`abbreviateBranch`)
 * @param maxWidth the width available to the whole destination line
 * @param labelWidth measured width of [label]
 * @param abbrevLabelWidth measured width of [abbreviatedLabel]
 * @param fullBranchWidth measured width of "/$branch"
 * @param abbrevBranchWidth measured width of "/$abbreviatedBranch"
 * @param minStubWidth measured width of the terminus floor's first glyph **plus an ellipsis** — the
 *   smallest a recognizable stub can render beside the whole branch; below it the render would show
 *   only "…", so the branch takes the row alone instead
