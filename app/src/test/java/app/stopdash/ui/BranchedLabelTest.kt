/**
 * [branchedLabel]'s rule, tested apart from the measuring composable. Widths are the abstract px the
 * caller measures; only their relative sizes matter, so the numbers here are chosen to land each
 * case rather than to match any real font. The composable lays the branch out whole at its natural
 * width and gives the terminus the leftover (ellipsized), so [branchedLabel] only picks which
 * strings show.
