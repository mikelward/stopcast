/**
 * The fix-selection policy ([FixSelection.resolve]) that fixes the field bug where "Finding
 * stops near you…" waited ~5 s and then failed with "couldn't get your location": a recent
 * cached fix is used at once, a fresh fix is bounded, and a slow/absent fresh fix falls back
 * to a cached one — but only while it is recent enough, so an old fix isn't shown as "near me
 * now". The framework glue (`getCurrentLocation` / `getLastKnownLocation`) is injected as
 * fakes, so the policy is exercised on the JVM with virtual time — no device or Robolectric.
 * Coordinates are obviously-synthetic fixtures, never a real position (SPEC *Privacy*).
