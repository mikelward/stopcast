/**
 * Parses a rail `platformName` into the two cues the platform sub-header shows (SPEC D8: "Platform 2
 * (Eastbound)"): the **platform number** a rail place splits on ([platformNumber]) and the **compass
 * direction** that platform faces ([of]). TfL prints a rail platform as `"<Direction> - Platform N"` —
 * "Northbound - Platform 1", "Eastbound - Platform 2" — so both are read off the one string.
 *
 * The **platform** is the grouping key, not the compass: the compass alone conflates physically
 * distinct platforms — at King's Cross the Eastbound Circle/H&C/Met share one sub-surface platform
 * while the Eastbound Piccadilly is a different deep-tube platform — so keying on the platform number
 * keeps a header naming one physical platform. The compass rides along only as the direction cue in
 * parens, and it is read from the platform name rather than TfL's `inbound`/`outbound` `direction`
 * because the latter is **inconsistent across lines at one platform**: the Circle runs an Eastbound
 * platform as `inbound` while the Hammersmith & City runs the same platform as `outbound`, and some
 * predictions carry no `direction` at all (confirmed against live TfL data, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * [of] returns the direction label (`Northbound`, `Eastbound`, `Inner Rail`, …), or **null** when the
 * platform names no direction: a bare "Platform 4", an empty platform, or a **bus** pole's stop-local
 * `platform` ("Stop A", "Stop A / 1"). Only a recognized rail-direction form is accepted — a
 * **compass** bearing (a compass point + "bound", never TfL's `Inbound`/`Outbound` jargon) or a
 * sub-surface loop label ("Inner Rail" / "Outer Rail") — so neither a bus value nor the
 * inbound/outbound words are ever mistaken for a direction (which for a bus value would mislabel a
 * header and split one bus cluster's poles into separate groups — Codex P2, PR #109).
