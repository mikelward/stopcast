 * Where each near-me stop notice goes (SPEC *Disruptions*), given the list's [groups] and the ones
 * drawn in the loaded places' run ([listed]). Each notice arrives once per interchange (the fold
 * upstream), so each is drawn once:
 * - **on its pole** ([onPole], by the pole's group key) when it's filed against one bus pole
 *   alone, and that pole has its own section — "Bus Stop Closed" at Stop E says nothing about Stop F;
 * - **as its place's own group directly above the place's first listed section** ([aboveGroup], by
 *   that section's index in [listed]) — a station-wide notice, one heading for every platform;
 * - **as its own group, placed by distance** ([placeless]) when the place has no section listed: a
 *   closed station with nothing running, or a pole with no buses listed.
