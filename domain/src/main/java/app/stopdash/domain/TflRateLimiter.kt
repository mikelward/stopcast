/**
 * A shared, best-effort token bucket bounding the app's TfL request rate toward the budget.
 * **One instance is shared across every TfL client in the process** — MainActivity's departures
 * and discovery clients and WidgetRefreshWorker's — because a per-client bucket would each consume
 * the full allowance (Codex, PR #101).
 *
 * The bucket holds up to [capacity] tokens (the burst) and refills at [refillPerMinute]. Size
 * them so **[capacity] + [refillPerMinute] does not exceed the per-minute budget**: a full bucket
 * drained at once plus a minute's refill is the most any 60-second window admits, so an equal
 * capacity and refill (50 + 50) would allow ~2x the budget in the first minute (Codex, PR #108).
 * The burst covers a normal refresh at once; beyond it, [acquire] paces at the refill rate, which
 * **staggers a cold-start fan-out** — a burst larger than the bucket is spread out rather than
 * fired at once, the case that otherwise hits the limit right after an app update (maintainer,
 * 2026-09-22). A request that would wait longer than [maxWaitMillis] throws
 * [TflException.RateLimited] instead of deferring a background refresh indefinitely.
 *
 * A token is consumed **only when granted**, never reserved ahead: so a wait canceled by a
 * superseded refresh (which MainViewModel does routinely) reclaims nothing and can't accumulate
 * phantom debt against the budget (Codex, PR #108).
 *
 * **In-memory, so best-effort, not a hard guarantee** (Codex, PR #101): it resets on process death
 * (incl. a WorkManager restart) while TfL still counts the prior calls, and does not span a
 * separate widget process. Persisting the accounting across restarts to close that window is a
 * recorded follow-up (`TODO.md`), worth doing only if it stays cheap.
 *
 * Pure of Android — [nowMillis] (a **monotonic** source in production, so a device clock
 * correction can't wedge the limiter) and [sleep] are injected, so it's JVM-testable on a virtual
 * clock. Concurrency-safe: the token accounting runs under a [Mutex]; the wait happens **outside**
 * the lock, so a paced request doesn't block others, and each waiter re-checks after sleeping
 * rather than holding a reservation.
